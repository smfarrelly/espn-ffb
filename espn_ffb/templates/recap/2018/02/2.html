        <p>{{ r.opponent }} must be shaking his head as his team threw away a historic effort by Patrick Mahomes. Mahomes had not
          <a href="https://streamable.com/una04">1</a>, not <a href="https://streamable.com/v8to0">2</a>, not <a href="https://streamable.com/804cj">3</a>,
          not <a href="https://streamable.com/dj5r0">4</a>, not <a href="https://streamable.com/acbdb">5</a>, but <a href="https://streamable.com/s7tt7">6</a> touchdowns for the day, breaking the NFL records for most touchdown passes in the first two games of the season.
          Sadly, his effort was immediately nullified by Kirk "Kurt" Cousins who threw for 425yd and 4td.

          Missing from action was {{ r.opponent }}' wide receiver corp as the Julio Jones and Keenan Allen duo checked in forgettable performances. On the other side of the coin, both Will Fuller V and Matt Breida had long touchdowns.
          Fuller hauled in this <a href="https://streamable.com/xnyy7">39yd td bomb</a> from Deshaun Watson and Breida ran for a <a href="https://streamable.com/qhilr">66yd td</a> behind the coattails of Pierre Garcon for the score.

          Perhaps {{ r.opponent }}' biggest regret remained on the bench as his Bears D/ST would have made up the difference and given him the win. Both {{ r.opponent }} and {{ r.team }} walk away 1-1.
